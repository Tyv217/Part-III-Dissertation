With the developments made in Concept Bottleneck Models,
finding optimal interventions for these models
to maximize their performance under a given budget is an important issue, as it allows
us to maximize the performance of these interpretable models while minimizing
the costs related to expert interventions. This project investigates solving this problem
using a new approach that combines Reinforcement Learning with surrogate models, with the goal
of maximizing intervention performance while maintaining similar performance to the original model
when no interventions are performed.

Compared to 
previous approaches that only use greedy policies, 
such as heuristic-based methods or learning a Machine Learning model for a greedy policy,
the main idea of this project
is to use Reinforcement Learning to learn a non-greedy policy to maximize the performance
gain from interventions over a budget rather than at each step. This is done by modelling the problem 
of deciding
what concept to intervene on as a Reinforcement Learning problem to maximize the final performance,
using surrogate models that model the distribution of concepts as intermediate rewards. When used in conjunction
with methods to increase sensitivity of models to interventions, this project successfully develops a novel
RL-based method that outperforms existing greedy intervention policies for different budgets, while maintaining
similar un-intervened performance. 

This project proposes the idea of learning non-greedy
intervention policies for Concept Bottleneck Models and incorporates budgets into the problem setting, 
and shows that
different budgets can have different optimal intervention trajectories where
non-greedy policies outperform greedy policies.
This project also successfully shows that 
Reinforcement Learning can be applied to this approach to generate more optimal intervention policies
that lead to better performance
compared to existing greedy approaches.
