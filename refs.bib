TITLE = {Robust Data Augmentation for Neural Machine Translation through EVALNET},
JOURNAL = {Mathematics},
VOLUME = {11},
YEAR = {2023},
NUMBER = {1},

ABSTRACT = {Since building Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems requires a large parallel corpus, various data augmentation techniques have been adopted, especially for low-resource languages. In order to achieve the best performance through data augmentation, the NMT systems should be able to evaluate the quality of augmented data. Several studies have addressed data weighting techniques to assess data quality. The basic idea of data weighting adopted in previous studies is the loss value that a system calculates when learning from training data. The weight derived from the loss value of the data, through simple heuristic rules or neural models, can adjust the loss used in the next step of the learning process. In this study, we propose EvalNet, a data evaluation network, to assess parallel data of NMT. EvalNet exploits a loss value, a cross-attention map, and a semantic similarity between parallel data as its features. The cross-attention map is an encoded representation of cross-attention layers of Transformer, which is a base architecture of an NMT system. The semantic similarity is a cosine distance between two semantic embeddings of a source sentence and a target sentence. Owing to the parallelism of data, the combination of the cross-attention map and the semantic similarity proved to be effective features for data quality evaluation, besides the loss value. EvalNet is the first NMT data evaluator network that introduces the cross-attention map and the semantic similarity as its features. Through various experiments, we conclude that EvalNet is simple yet beneficial for robust training of an NMT system and outperforms the previous studies as a data evaluator.},

The offline task involves translating English speech to German, Japanese and Chinese text. Our Speech Translation systems are trained end-to-end and are based on large pretrained speech and text models. We use an efficient fine-tuning technique that trains only specific layers of our system, and explore the use of adapter modules for the non-trainable layers. We further investigate the suitability of different speech encoders (wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT) for our models and the impact of knowledge distillation from the Machine Translation model that we use for the decoder (mBART). For segmenting the IWSLT test sets we fine-tune a pretrained audio segmentation model and achieve improvements of 5 BLEU compared to the given segmentation. Our best single model uses HuBERT and parallel adapters and achieves 29.42 BLEU at English-German MuST-C tst-COMMON and 26.77 at IWSLT 2020 test. By ensembling many models, we further increase translation quality to 30.83 BLEU and 27.78 accordingly. Furthermore, our submission for English-Japanese achieves 15.85 and English-Chinese obtains 25.63 BLEU on the MuST-C tst-COMMON sets. Finally, we extend our system to perform English-German Speech-to-Speech Translation with a pretrained Text-to-Speech model.",

      abstractNote={&lt;p&gt;Data augmentation with Mixup (Zhang et al. 2018) has shown to be an effective model regularizer for current art deep classification networks. It generates out-of-manifold samples through linearly interpolating inputs and their corresponding labels of random sample pairs. Despite its great successes, Mixup requires convex combination of the inputs as well as the modeling targets of a sample pair, thus significantly limits the space of its synthetic samples and consequently its regularization effect. To cope with this limitation, we propose “nonlinear Mixup”. Unlike Mixup where the input and label pairs share the same, linear, scalar mixing policy, our approach embraces nonlinear interpolation policy for both the input and label pairs, where the mixing policy for the labels is adaptively learned based on the mixed input. Experiments on benchmark sentence classification datasets indicate that our approach significantly improves upon Mixup. Our empirical studies also show that the out-of-manifold samples generated by our strategy encourage training samples in each class to form a tight representation cluster that is far from others.&lt;/p&gt;},
